Hi, I’m Sagar.

I’m a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for computer vision and product development. I hold a Bachelor's degree in _Mechanical Engineering_ from the **University of Mumbai** and a _Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and Management_ from **Technische Universität Hamburg (TUHH)**, specializing in product development and planning.

My professional experience spans precision optics technology applied in space, defense, and biotechnology sectors, primarily within manufacturing and quality control. Currently, I am focusing on integrating these precision technologies with machine vision and machine learning to drive innovative product development.

I am proficient in Python and well-versed in extensive machine vision libraries such as OpenCV, enabling me to develop and deploy complex computer vision solutions.

This website serves as a platform to showcase my projects and share insights from my ongoing professional journey.
